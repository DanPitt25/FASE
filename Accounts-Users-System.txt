We are clearly out of sync with how accounts and users are supposed to work, so let's bring it back.
We are using Firebase Auth and Firestore documents to handle all user-specific content. Both are created, at once, in the signup process.
This creates a Firebase Auth profile, namely the first user logging in. Other users can be listed (and will have a Members subcollection document in the Accounts collection) but they will need to create their own Firebase Auth.
Here is an example of a Firestore Accounts document:
