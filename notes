Make the organisation type required (page 1)
Privacy and data processing step (page 2): add embedded PDF of the kind that forces you to scroll down? Let's just embed text for now and see how it feels.
Organisation details (page 4): "Country headquartered" (or whatever is the standard phrasing) with a list of all the countries - one of those nice ones you can search, probably a library somewhere?
Regulatory and compliance section we can get rid of (page 5)
Registered address (page 6): should say explicitly "of head office".
Country dropdown -> all countries, Europe at the top (is this possible?)
Postcode / ZIP code (does this account for all European countries? can we find a better term?)
Get rid of senior leadership team section (page 7).
Remove technology section (page 12).
Get rid of the prices in the GWP dropdown (leave it a surprise for the end) (page 11).
Make clear that portfolio mix is approximate (remove references to 100%) (page 13).
Replace specialty with surety percentage breakdown (idk what this means right now so skip)
Target markets but explain what it is... (skip for now)
Lose open info. (skip)
FASE Code of Conduct at final. (we will have this shortly).
Other association memberships (V IMPORTANT! - we need to say somewhere whether the prospective member is in any other association. Let's start off with just yes / no, and then a dropdown including ASASE, NVGA, MGAA, other, we will add more. Worth putting on page 1.)
Clarify total premium. (skip)
