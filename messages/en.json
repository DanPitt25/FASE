There is a risk to customers in the event that an insurer fails and is unable to pay valid claims.\n\nFASE expects MGA Members to be able to demonstrate that suitable due diligence has been performed on the insurers that they represent and offer as insurance security.\n\nMembers should provide clear and unambiguous detail of the name and address of the insurer in all the relevant documentation provided for brokers and policyholders. We expect Members to positively avoid giving the policyholder the impression that the MGA is the insurer and obscure the name of the insurer behind the MGA. It is important that customers can make an informed decision on where their insurance is being placed."
