**FASE is delighted to announce the inaugural MGA Rendezvous, a unique conference focused exclusively on European MGA professionals, taking place from June 17-18, 2025 in London.**

&nbsp;

**December 18, 2025** – The Federation of European Managing General Agents (FASE) is excited to unveil the inaugural MGA Rendezvous, scheduled for June 17-18, 2025 in London. This groundbreaking conference represents the first pan-European event designed specifically for the MGA community, bringing together industry professionals from across the continent.

&nbsp;

The MGA Rendezvous will focus on the unique challenges and opportunities facing European MGAs in today's evolving insurance landscape. From regulatory harmonization to digital transformation, capacity relationships to emerging risks, the conference agenda will address the issues that matter most to MGA professionals and their capacity providers.

&nbsp;

"The European MGA market is incredibly dynamic, but also fragmented across different regulatory frameworks and business cultures," said William Pitt, Executive Director of FASE. "The MGA Rendezvous will be the first truly continental platform where European MGAs can share insights, forge partnerships, and collectively shape the future of our industry."

&nbsp;

The conference will feature panel discussions with leading MGA executives, capacity providers, and regulatory experts, as well as dedicated networking opportunities designed to foster collaboration across borders. Attendees will gain valuable insights into market trends, regulatory developments, and best practices from peers across Europe.

&nbsp;

Key themes will include:

• Cross-border expansion strategies for European MGAs

• Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape

• Digital innovation in underwriting and distribution

• Sustainable capacity relationships in a challenging market

• The role of MGAs in addressing emerging risks

&nbsp;

The MGA Rendezvous is exclusively for FASE members and their capacity providers. Member organizations can register teams of delegates, with early bird rates available until March 2025.

&nbsp;

FASE represents over 50 MGA organizations across Europe, from established market leaders to innovative start-ups. The federation works to advance the interests of European MGAs through regulatory advocacy, market intelligence, and community building.
