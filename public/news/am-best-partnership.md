**FASE is pleased to announce that AM Best is a Silver sponsor and will contribute to FASE's member communications, including the federation's monthly member bulletin, the Entrepreneurial Underwriter, on topics relating to professional standards in the MGA market. In addition, AM Best will host a FASE webinar series, entitled "Hallmarks of a high-performance MGA."**

&nbsp;

Since 2022, AM Best has been conducting performance assessments for delegated underwriting authority enterprises, which include MGAs, offering a forward-looking, independent and objective non-credit opinion of MGAs' ability to perform underwriting, claims handling and administrative functions on behalf of their carrier partners. Market insights gathered from this process will be made available to FASE members.

&nbsp;

Andrea Keenan, executive vice president and chief strategy officer at AM Best Rating Services, said: "Given the robust growth of European MGA market, we applaud the efforts of FASE to raise the profile of the delegated underwriting sector. AM Best is excited to share our unique perspective with the federation's members."

&nbsp;

William Pitt, FASE executive director, welcomed AM Best's support: "AM Best brings deep experience of the evolution of delegated underwriting around the world – and the continuing professionalization of the sector – that will be of great relevance and value to our members."
