**New pan-European federation connects all participants in the growing, thriving specialist underwriting market**

&nbsp;

**Amsterdam, 4 November 2025** – The Fédération des Agences de Souscription Européennes (FASE) is launched today to serve the needs of Europe's managing general agents. FASE connects MGAs and insurance capacity providers, brokers, investors, and service providers, shares best practice, and unites a sector comprising multiple independent operators to give MGAs a powerful single voice.

&nbsp;

Steered by an advisory committee drawn from the membership, FASE is structured to help entrepreneurial underwriting businesses seize opportunities and meet the challenges they face as they build their businesses in Europe. Alongside opportunities to expand networks and build trusted relationships, FASE delivers information and education through webinars, bulletins, and events.

&nbsp;

"We've created FASE to respond to a clear market need," said FASE executive director William Pitt. "MGAs play an increasingly important role in the European response to challenging risks. They contribute enormously to the development of a more responsive and integrated market. FASE exists to smooth their path."

&nbsp;

Mike Keating, a member of FASE's advisory board and CEO of the MGAA (Managing General Agents' Association), which represents MGAs in the UK and Ireland, welcomed the launch of the pan-European federation: "MGAs bring underwriting expertise, product innovation and a very high standard of customer service to the markets they serve. But they depend on close relationships with capacity providers – insurance companies, reinsurers, Lloyd's syndicates, and investors – and on the global insurance broking network. FASE aims to nourish and expand these relationships in Europe in addition to providing regulatory support."

&nbsp;

FASE offers opportunities for MGAs from across Europe to broaden their relationships with capacity providers and distributors through a series of events, including a pan-European MGA Rendezvous to take place next Spring.

&nbsp;

"MGAs are, in the main, small businesses," said Darío Spata, president of ASASE (Asociación de Agencias de Suscripción Españolas), Spain's MGA association, and a member of FASE's advisory board. "In insurance that can be a big advantage, because you can move faster. But as our members look to grow their business, they are sometimes hampered by regulatory obstacles, data gaps, and capacity constraints. FASE can help."

&nbsp;

Applications for FASE membership are open to MGAs that have been in business for more than a year and underwrite more than €500,000 in annual premium. Membership is also open to insurance and reinsurance companies that seek to partner with European MGAs, and to service providers that support the sector.

&nbsp;

"The MGA model is gaining momentum globally, and we expect this trend to continue, particularly in Europe" said Olaf Jonda, CEO of DUAL Europe and a FASE advisory board member. "Market dynamics such as the demand for flexibility, specialization, and access to niche capacity are encouraging more insurers and brokers to collaborate with MGAs. In this context, well-managed and highly professional MGA associations can play a pivotal role in contributing to the sector's growth. We see FASE stepping into this space to enhance and strengthen the MGA ecosystem across Europe."
