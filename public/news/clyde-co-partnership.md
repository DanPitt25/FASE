**FASE announces a two-year partnership with leading insurance law firm Clyde & Co to help FASE members navigate the demands of European regulation**

&nbsp;

**December 18, 2025** – FASE, the recently formed pan-European MGA federation, is delighted to announce a two-year partnership with leading insurance law firm, Clyde & Co, to help FASE members navigate the demands of European regulation.

&nbsp;

The regulatory demands on MGAs in Europe are varied and often complex. A patchwork quilt of regulation can impede the development of MGAs' business as they seek to expand their presence domestically and internationally.

&nbsp;

Clyde & Co brings exceptional knowledge of Europe's regulatory landscape as it affects MGAs and their capacity providers. FASE members will benefit from this expertise through articles in the Entrepreneurial Underwriter, the federation's flagship publication, as well as an interactive digital map, highlighting regulatory variations across Europe, due to be launched next year.

&nbsp;

Eva-Maria Barbosa, partner at Clyde & Co, comments "We're delighted to partner with FASE and to deepen our engagement with MGAs across the EU. Day-to-day we help MGAs and their capacity providers navigate Europe's patchwork of rules, and we look forward to sharing practical, usable insight drawn from the breadth of work we already support across the continent. Through this partnership we'll bring together our expertise in Regulatory, Claims Coverage & Defence and Policy Wording and, additionally, AI, Cyber and Technology to help FASE members turn complexity into confidence and growth."

&nbsp;

William Pitt, executive director at FASE, welcomed Clyde & Co's support. "Prior to establishing FASE, we asked MGAs across Europe where the organization could potentially add the most value. Support with regulatory challenges emerged as a high priority. We are determined to offer our members access to the best minds in insurance regulation and this partnership supports that goal."
