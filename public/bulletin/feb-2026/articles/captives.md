The role of reinsurance captives has been growing in the capacity stack of MGAs in the United States and United Kingdom. In the first of a series of monthly articles on captive management issues, Mark Elliott, CEO of Guernsey-based Polo Insurance Managers, highlights the top seven reasons why profitable MGAs of all sizes across Europe should consider establishing a captive.

It is estimated that there are over 300 MGAs in the UK retaining some of their own risk. But in continental Europe, MGAs have generally been slower to retain risk through captives. For MGAs that can demonstrate a profitable track record, there are seven good reasons to consider retaining risk through a captive.

## 1. Enhanced Margin Capture

Retaining a portion of the risk allows the MGA to participate directly in underwriting profits rather than ceding all value to capacity providers.

## 2. Greater Control Over Capacity

A captive reduces dependence on third-party insurers and reinsurers, improving resilience during hard markets or sudden capacity withdrawals.

## 3. Alignment of Underwriting Incentives

Retention enforces stronger underwriting discipline by directly linking portfolio performance to the MGA's own capital at risk.

## 4. Improved Negotiating Power with Carriers

Demonstrated "skin in the game" strengthens credibility and can lead to better commission terms, profit shares, and long-term capacity agreements. Indeed we have seen some clients who managed to increase commission just by having the captive in place – they didn't even take a retention initially.

## 5. Access to Reinsurance Markets on Better Terms

A captive can access quota share or excess-of-loss reinsurance directly, often at more efficient pricing than through fronted arrangements alone. There is still an insurance / reinsurance pricing arbitrage which we often see – especially when the incumbent insurer has been on the programme for many years.

## 6. Portfolio Diversification and Capital Efficiency

Well-structured captives (often domiciled in EU-friendly jurisdictions) allow optimized capital usage across lines, geographies, and cycles. Traditionally Malta is an excellent location for direct EU access, but requires scale. Guernsey can operate using a fronting insurer and can sometimes be more cost-effective from a cost and capital perspective for smaller programmes.

## 7. Strategic Optionality and Scalability

Captives enable controlled experimentation with new products, niches, or geographies without full reliance on external carriers. We need many new start-ups and the incubation of new products in their own captive helps collect data and demonstrates to insurers a positive alignment of interest.
